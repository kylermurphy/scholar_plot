# scholar_plot
Simple Plot for google scholar and scopus information

Requires [pybliometrics][1] for Scopus and [scholary][2] for Google Scholar.

pybliometrics was installed with pip, however it requires a license/network access and so publication numbers are hardcoded for now from [Scopus Author seach](https://www.scopus.com/freelookup/form/author.uri)
```
pip install pybliometrics
```

scholary was installed via GitHub
```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/OrganicIrradiation/scholarly.git
```
